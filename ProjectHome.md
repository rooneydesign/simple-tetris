Tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union. It was released on June 6, 1984,[2](2.md) while he was working for the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science of the USSR in Moscow.[3](3.md) He derived its name from the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (all of the game's pieces contain four segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.
